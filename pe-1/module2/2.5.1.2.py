#this program computes the number of seconds in a given number of hours

hours = 2 # number of hours
seconds_per_hour = 3600 # number of seconds in 1 hour

# print("Hours: ", hours) # printing the number of hours
print("Seconds in Hours: ", hours * seconds_per_hour) # printing the number of seconds in a given number of hours

# here we should also print "Goodbye", but a programmer didn't have time to write any code
